# Investing-In-Nashville
<h2>Introduction</h2><br>

A real estate agency intending to invest significantly in the rapidly booming Nashville region. The dataset we were given pertains to real estate. The dataset we were given pertains to real estate which consists of various attributes that has an impact on the pricing of the land. They've gathered data on previous deals and would like us to create a model to assist them in precisely identifying the best value offers. There is concern that properties may sell for more than their listing price, and this dataset can assist us in observing this. The objective is to determine which qualities have the greatest impact on land pricing.<br>
<h2>Task</h2><br>
Built a logistic regression model to accurately predict housing prices and determine what is driving those prices.<br>
Built a Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boost model to predict housing prices and find important features to predict it.<br>
Used multiple benchmarking metrics to compare and contrast the four models.<br>
